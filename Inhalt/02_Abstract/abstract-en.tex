This work compares several U-Net-based architectures using various pre-training, fine-tuning, and 
augmentation methods to recognize and semantically segment cycle ways in cities. 
To that end, multiple data sets are created and automatically annotated using a custom algorithm 
and OpenStreetMap data. In order to evaluate the results, a buffered form of \textit{\acf{IoU}}, 
called \textit{\acf{BIoU}}, which is the rasterized version of the \textit{Quality} measure, is developed. \\
Results show mediocre success for recognizing cycle ways, especially for cities 
with different infrastructure than that used during training. 
The impact of different architectures and training methodologies does not show 
performance improvements consistently and is deemed insignificant.
