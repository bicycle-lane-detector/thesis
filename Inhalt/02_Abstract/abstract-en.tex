This thesis develops an efficient algorithm for calculating the similarity of two material flow graphs based on the number of common node labels. Material flow graphs are  node-labelled \acp{DAG} with many nodes of outdegree one, which share a common sub-\ac{DAG} whenever they share a node with a common label. \\
It was previously found that comparing two material flow graphs by simply counting their common node labels is inefficient. Rather, this process can be siginificantly sped up by making use of the sharing sub-\ac{DAG} property by, first, reducing the graph to only sink and fork nodes (where fork nodes are nodes with outdegree greater 1), and then comparing the reduced graphs. This allowed for a speed-up of  factor 10 for average problems, whereas the comparison of especially large material flow graphs with very few fork nodes and sinks could be sped up by factor 83 to 168.
